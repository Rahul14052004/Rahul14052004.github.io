            <h2>üéµ Music</h2>
            <p>
                Music has always been a profound passion of mine. From classical compositions to contemporary beats, 
                I find myself drawn to the intricate patterns and emotional depth that music offers. My interest in 
                Indian classical music led me to work on transcription projects, bridging my technical skills with 
                my musical interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy exploring different genres, understanding musical theory, and occasionally experimenting with 
                music production. The mathematical precision in music composition fascinates me and often inspires 
                my approach to problem-solving in programming.

            <h2>‚öΩ Sports</h2>
            <p>
                Sports, particularly football (soccer), play a significant role in my life. I'm an avid follower of 
                the Premier League and enjoy analyzing team strategies, player performances, and match statistics. 
                This passion led me to create the Premier Insights project, where I apply machine learning to predict 
                match outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond watching, I also enjoy playing football and other sports. The teamwork, strategy, and physical 
                challenge that sports provide offer a perfect balance to my academic and technical pursuits. I believe 
                the discipline and strategic thinking from sports greatly benefit my approach to complex problem-solving.

            <h2>üé¨ Movies & Cinema</h2>
            <p>
                Cinema is another realm where I find endless fascination. From analyzing cinematography techniques to 
                appreciating storytelling methods, movies provide both entertainment and inspiration. I particularly 
                enjoy science fiction and drama genres, often finding parallels between cinematic narratives and 
                technological possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in movies extends to understanding the technical aspects of filmmaking, including the role 
                of technology in modern cinema. This led me to work with movie databases and APIs, creating applications 
                that help others discover and explore films. The intersection of technology and entertainment continues 
                to inspire my projects and career aspirations.

            <h2>üìö Learning & Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond my primary interests, I'm constantly exploring new technologies, reading about emerging trends 
                in AI and machine learning, and staying updated with the latest developments in computer science. 
                I enjoy participating in online competitions, attending tech talks, and engaging with the broader 
                tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
                This continuous learning mindset helps me stay innovative and brings fresh perspectives to my projects. 
                Whether it's exploring a new programming language, understanding a complex algorithm, or diving into 
                a completely different field, I believe in the power of interdisciplinary knowledge.
