    </header>

    <section class="project-detail">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>MovieScore</strong> is a movie search portal that allows users to search for movie descriptions, cast details, and availability across major streaming platforms. 
            The application connects to <strong>TMDB (The Movie Database) API</strong> and cross-references data with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ to provide streaming availability.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of streaming services, users often need to search across multiple platforms to find where a movie is available. 
            MovieScore aims to simplify this by offering a unified portal that retrieves movie details and lists streaming availability, streamlining the user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Team Members</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rayyan Hussain â€“ <i>TMDB API Integration & GUI</i></li>
            <li>Rahul Ramesh Omalur â€“ <i>Platform Availability (OTT) Checker</i></li>
            <li>Mehul Aggarwal â€“ <i>Backend & Testing</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> â€“ Core development language</li>
            <li><strong>TMDB API</strong> â€“ Movie data and metadata</li>
            <li><strong>Tkinter</strong> â€“ Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
            <li><strong>Pandas & CSV</strong> â€“ Platform availability checks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for movies by title or genre.</li>
            <li>Retrieve movie descriptions, cast lists, and ratings.</li>
            <li>Check streaming availability on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+.</li>
            <li>Simple GUI for intuitive user interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
        <p>
            The project is structured around a single Python file with approximately 134 lines of code. The core components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class: Movie</strong> â€“ Represents movie objects fetched from the TMDB API.</li>
            <li><strong>Function: createMovieObjects</strong> â€“ Generates movie objects from API data.</li>
            <li><strong>Function: platCheck</strong> â€“ Checks platform availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Function: returnOTT</strong> â€“ Returns streaming platforms for selected movies.</li>
            <li><strong>Function: results</strong> â€“ Displays movie search results in the Tkinter GUI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Interface (GUI)</h2>
        <p>
            The GUI was built using <strong>Tkinter</strong>, allowing users to input movie titles and receive instant feedback.  
            A simple but effective layout displays movie details alongside platform availability, enhancing usability and user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Testing involved verifying individual functions and components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A rough sketch of the GUI was translated into Tkinter.</li>
            <li>Specific movies were tested using the TMDB API to verify accuracy.</li>
            <li>A CSV file containing movies and platform data was cross-referenced to validate streaming availability.</li>
            <li>Each API call was monitored and debugged individually to ensure correct data retrieval.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>
        <p>
            One of the primary challenges was managing API rate limits and handling platform discrepancies between regions.  
            Additionally, synchronizing TMDB data with CSV records required careful filtering and validation. 
            This project improved our understanding of working with APIs, handling GUI events, and managing external data sources.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand to more streaming platforms (e.g., Apple TV+, HBO Max).</li>
            <li>Implement user authentication and save favorite searches.</li>
            <li>Introduce a recommendation system based on movie search history.</li>
            <li>Add movie trailers and reviews to the results page.</li>
        </ul>
