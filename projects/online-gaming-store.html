        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves developing an online retail store specifically tailored for gaming products. 
            Users can browse, purchase, and manage gaming-related items through an intuitive web interface. 
            The platform integrates essential e-commerce features such as product listings, user accounts, and cart functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            With the gaming industry rapidly expanding, the need for dedicated online platforms for gaming gear and digital products has grown. 
            This project aims to deliver a seamless online shopping experience for gamers while implementing core web development and database management concepts.
        </p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

            <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> Frontend for creating the user interface.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL (DBMS):</strong> Database for storing product information, user accounts, and orders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features (Planned)</h2>

            <li>Secure checkout and simulated payment integration.</li>
            <li>Admin dashboard for inventory management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The project will follow a modular development approach, focusing on the following stages:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Create relational tables for users, products, orders, and transactions.</li>
